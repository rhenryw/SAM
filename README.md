# SAM
Self Aware Machine (SAM) is a small, self contained (no WiFi needed, all local) Artificial Intelligence companion


I am making this because I had a little robot toy called Cosmo, but he was pretty dumb and needed constant WiFi, I wanna run a small local AI model that can tell SAM where to go, answer simple questions through a microphone, and see his surroundings

So far I haven't done too much designing, and haven't completed the BOM yet.
